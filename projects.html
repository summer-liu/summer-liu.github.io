           <h3> Previous Projects:</h3>
           
           <ul>
      <li> <h3>3D Campus Program</h3> </li>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3D campus program is sponsored by MSRA and USTC to build a smart campus. As a team of four students, we use a 3D laser scanner to get the 3D data of all the buildings in campus, build the 3D model,do texture mapping, and build a software with functionality  such as navigation,virtual walkthroughs. My work mostly focus on carrying the big scanner to scan the buildings in campus and texture mapping of all the buildings using 3DMax and OpenGL.

      <li>    <h3>Multiview Visual Search based on Scalable Vocabulary Tree</h3>  </li>
      
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Object recognition is one of the core problems in
computer vision. One of the important challenges is to construct methods
that scale well with the size of the database, and can select
one out of a large number of objects in acceptable time. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more
discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently. Another challenge is how to combine multiple views of an object to increase retrieval quality. In the experiment, I extracted sift features of 10000 images in Caltech256 database, and trained a vocabulary tree to do visual search and object recognition using multiple views of an object. I proposed several methods to comine multiview feature, and the result of multiview visual search is slightly better than single view search.[<a href="file/Multiview Visual Search based on Scalable Vocabulary Tree.pdf">Report</a>]</p>

 <li>    <h3> RoboGame 2010</h3>  </li> 


<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspI took part in the RoboGame of USTC with a team of 5 students. We designed and built a remote-controlled humanoid robot and an automatic flat car robot. The 4-leg humanoid robot can move with different directions and paces to pick up the balls and throw them to the opponent's field. And we programmed the flat car robot to automatically detect the balls in the field and reel in the balls like a reaper and then shot out them to the opponent's field.
<p>&nbsp</p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was the leader of our team and and organized the work of our team.My work was the circuit part. I learned the basic theory of the circuit design with the software Protel. And then we made the PCB in a company based on our circuit diagram. Later I welded all the circuit boards of our robots: four for motor drive,two for power source, one for remote control, and one for photoelectric sensor. Also I helped with the parameter testing of our robots.[<a href="file/F++PPT.pdf">Presentation Slides(Chinese Version)</a>]</p>
